		<p>The Pirate Softplay is a great softplay set and is ideal for kids under the age of 2 years old. This softplay set is for indoor use only as the softplay is not waterproof due to the design. This item is extremly popular so early booking is advised. The pirate softplay goes great with the pirate box bounce which can be booked with the set for an extra £50</p>
